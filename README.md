This project demonstrates my grasp of key concepts and practical skills in Databas-teknik.  
ChatGPT has been helpful for generating seed-data and assisting me with this README file which is lets face it much better especially with icons and layout.



**🌟 Overview**
This project implements a hybrid database architecture for a chat system using:
🐘 PostgreSQL — structured relational data
🍃 MongoDB — flexible, high-volume event data

The system models:
👤 Users
🛡 Roles
💬 Channels
🔗 Channel memberships
🏷 Role assignments
📨 Messages
📜 Join/leave logs

The goal is to demonstrate proper relational modeling principles combined with practical postgres usage.

🏗 System Architecture
The system separates data storage responsibilities based on data structure and behavior.

📦 Data Type	🗄 Database	🎯 Why
    Users	    PostgreSQL	Strong consistency
    Roles	    PostgreSQL	Permission control
    Channels	PostgreSQL	Relational integrity
    Memberships	PostgreSQL	N–N enforcement
    Messages	MongoDB	    Write-heavy, flexible schema, storage
    Join Logs	MongoDB	    Event-based storage

✅ Structured data → Relational database
✅ Dynamic, log-based data → Document database

🐘 Relational Layer – PostgreSQL

Fully normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF).

🔑 Features Implemented

✔ Primary Keys

✔ Foreign Keys

✔ CHECK Constraints

✔ UNIQUE Constraints

✔ ON DELETE CASCADE

✔ Composite Primary Keys

✔ View Definition

✔ Aggregate Queries

🧩 Core Tables
users
channels
roles
user_channel_memberships
user_roles

🔄 Relationship Design
1–N → Users → Memberships
1–N → Channels → Memberships
N–N → Users ↔ Channels
N–N → Users ↔ Roles

👁 View
channel_member_view
Provides a joined representation of channels and their members using SQL JOINs.


🍃 Document Layer – MongoDB
MongoDB stores:
📨 Messages
📜 Channel Join/Leave Logs
🚀 Why MongoDB?
🧩 Flexible Schema
Messages may evolve with:
Reactions 👍
Attachments 📎
Edits ✏
Metadata 🏷

No schema migrations required.

⚡ High Write Throughput
Chat systems are:
Insert-heavy
Time-based
Append-driven
MongoDB handles this efficiently.

📜 Event-Based Modeling
Join logs are naturally represented as document-based events.
Example:
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "channel_id": 1,
  "event": "join",
  "timestamp": ISODate("2026-02-25T09:00:00Z")
}
🗺 ER Diagram (Conceptual)
[ USERS ] ----< [ USER_CHANNEL_MEMBERSHIPS ] >---- [ CHANNELS ]
     |
     v
[ USER_ROLES ] >---- [ ROLES ]

✔ Junction tables implement N–N relationships
✔ Referential integrity enforced via foreign keys

Setup guide
Run the schema.sql in Datagrip or cli
Run the seeds.sql in Datagrip or cli
Run queries.sql in Datagrip, -> if you wanna run queries in cli being bash or cmd open the file with notepad or any other text editor and run
    the query of choice.
